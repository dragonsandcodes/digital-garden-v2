## ⁉️ Why the D#CK did I start I coding?

I have worked almost a decade in digital marketing, and worked with amazing brands like Hyundai Motors, Raiffeisen Bank and Black Toast Music as a social media strategist. Also lead the social media marketing team of one of Hungary's biggest marketing agencies at only 24 years old.

Than we hopped on a plane and lived out of our suitcases for 1,5 years as digital nomads, and went through the biggest change as a person. I was sick of selling stuff. Before this every marketing strategy was a new puzzle for me. I loved finding ways to create buzz for a product. I was fucking proud when I talked about mortgage in a way people got interested in buying a new home.

Man, I even had a 4-page-long interview with in Glamour Magazine about my freelancing career...

But after finally seeing more of the world than I ever imagened, I felt sick. There is so much access, so much pushing of just buy, buy, buy... _(Looking at you LA)_ So in December of 2022 I left marketing behind.

For a few months I felt lost, but thanks to my mentor [@thedevdavid](https://twitter.com/thedevdavid) I started my coding journey in March 2023.

**Since than**

- I reached millions of people with my TikToks around the world.
- Work with amazing brands like DevHero
- Had my first public speaking event with [WeAreDevelopers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/)

So here we are now. Let's see what's next...
