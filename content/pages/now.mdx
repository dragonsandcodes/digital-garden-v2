## 📍 Where am I?

Currently living in the sunny _( during the summer months )_ Barcelona, but ready to hop on a plane and continue my digital nomad adventures anytime.

## 👩‍💻 What I'm working on / learning currently?

1.  Creating my first video game with Unreal Engine 5.
2.  Learning to use TypeScript like a master.
3.  Building my follower base on TikTok and YouTube as @dragonsandcodes

## 📅 I am available for:

- public speaking
- content collaboration
- UGC content creation
- starting a game development internship _(except for Blizzard. Don't like weirdos)_
